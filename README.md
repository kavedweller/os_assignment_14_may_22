### Laravel Request Lifecycle


#### Problem 1:

You have a Laravel application with a form that submits user information using a POST request. Write the code to retrieve the 'name' input field value from the request and store it in a variable called $name.

 

#### Problem 2:

In your Laravel application, you want to retrieve the value of the 'User-Agent' header from the current request. Write the code to accomplish this and store the value in a variable called $userAgent.

 

#### Problem 3:

You are building an API endpoint in Laravel that accepts a GET request with a 'page' query parameter. Write the code to retrieve the value of the 'page' parameter from the current request and store it in a variable called $page. If the parameter is not present, set $page to null.

 

#### Problem 4:

Create a JSON response in Laravel with the following data:

 ```JSON
{
    "message": "Success",
    "data": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "age": 25
    }
}
```

#### Problem 5:

You are implementing a file upload feature in your Laravel application. Write the code to handle a file upload named 'avatar' in the current request and store the uploaded file in the 'public/uploads' directory. Use the original filename for the uploaded file.

 

#### Problem 6:

Retrieve the value of the 'remember_token' cookie from the current request in Laravel and store it in a variable called $rememberToken. If the cookie is not present, set $rememberToken to null.

 

#### Problem 7:

Create a route in Laravel that handles a POST request to the '/submit' URL. Inside the route closure, retrieve the 'email' input parameter from the request and store it in a variable called $email. Return a JSON response with the following data:

```JSON
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Form submitted successfully."
}
```
